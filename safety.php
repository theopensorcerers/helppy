						<li><h2>Communicate:</h2>

						<p>Before starting a new project, make sure you agree with other helppers on working time, 
							availability, skills or anything else you consider important. Helppy offers a messaging 
							system with this purpose. Avoid possible conflicts by stating what you expect from each 
							transaction from the beginning. </p></li>

						<li><h2>Examine other helppers profiles: </h2>

						<p>Reviews, ratings and the time spent helping or being helped are there for a reason. Take
						 advantage of these tools to make sure you will work with the best possible person for you. </p></li>

						<li><h2>Give feedback: </h2>

						<p>If youve had a good experience with a helper, or (let's hope not) the opposite happens, the rest of the community 
							deserves to know it. Let’s make Helppy a safe environment. </p></li>

						<li><h2>Meet your helpper: </h2>
						<p>We encourage people to meet in person when possible. It is always good to know who will 
							work with you, and sometimes your project will require meetings anyway. You can use 
							the map on your profile page to mark the places you are comfortable working or meeting in. 
							However, great friendships and collaborations can happen online too and Helppy is a great 
							tool for this. </p>

						<li><h2>Make smart choices: </h2>
						<p>If you want to see your project grow, does your research and choose the right person to work with. 
							Remember, not only the best rated helppers are good, there is always new talent coming in that 
							might not have ratings yet but might be worth a try. </p></li>

						<li><h2>Be careful with personal information: </h2>
						 <p>You chose what to display on your profile’s description. Think twice before posting information 
						 	such as telephone numbers or domestic addresses. </p></li>

						<li><h2>Be nice: </h2>
						<p>Don’t overwork your helpper. Remember this is a voluntary skill-sharing platform with the aim of 
							building great projects together. Lets keep it friendly.
						Give credit: Clearly state the help you have received in each project.  Helppers are not working 
						for you, they are working with you and every project you finish is also theirs. </p></li>
