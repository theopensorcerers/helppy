					We imagine an environment of collaboration between people. The more hands helping each other, the better!</br>

					Helppers get together and work on interdisciplinary projects by sharing their knowledge and skills.
					Helppy is a community of people who care about learning from others, enjoy the process of creativity,
					are excited to work with people from different disciplines and are interested in increasing their professional and social network.</p></br>
					<h2>The story behind</h2></br>
					<p> We are students of the Design Informatics masters programme at The University of Edinburgh. This course welcomes students with a wide variety of skills. 
					We are often asked to come up with conceptual, technological and design approaches to data driven projects. 
					In class, some people have brilliant programming skills but lack knowledge in design software or struggle with creative thinking, a new world to them. 
					Whereas most designers in the course easily brainstorm, sketch and prototype ideas, but face problems when trying to realize them due to their 
					lack of coding skills. The background diversity of this programme is what makes it rich, and collaboration between students is essential 
					to make great projects. However we often find difficult to know how others can help us, what skills are available and who is willing 
					to give share their time with a busy schedule. Which makes the task of asking for help hard and results in little collaboration.</br></br>
					To address these issues the class developed an analogue approach, a ticket system. In which each student writes 3 of their 
					skills on a piece of paper as detachable tickets and hangs them on a wall in the classroom. By grabbing tickets of our choice 
					we can exchange help or services. However we believe this approach could grow making it easier for us to negotiate, communicate, 
					offer and receive help. This is why we have created Helppy, an open source website that will hopefully expand to bigger contexts,
					 better collaboration and greater projects. </p>
