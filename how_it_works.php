				  <h2>How Helppy Works</h2>
				  <p> 
				  	Let’s keep it short:</br>
					Frank spent several weeks coding a new computer game he created. However, he couldn’t help but 
					notice that his idea was not as easy to understand as he expected. People didn’t understand 
					how it worked or how to use it and lets face it, even he thought it looked bad… really bad.  
					How could this game compete with all the other ones in the market if he lacked the skills 
					to make it better?  And how on earth could a broke student like him pay someone to help him? </p>

				<p>
					He found Helppy and looked for graphics, and character design skills and found people who wanted 
					to be a part of this project. He contacted them and worked with them until he finally finished his 
					project. He appreciated these people’s willingness and realized he could also be there for 
					someone else. So he posted all the skills he could offer to others. Since then he has been a part 
					of various projects, from web design, to animation and even robotics.  He hasn’t ’spent a cent, he 
					has met people from all backgrounds and has cultivated great friendships. 
				</p>
				<h2>To be a part of Helppy just follow these steps:</h2>
				<ol>
					<li><h3>Sign up:</h3> 
					<p>You can explore which skills are available without signing up, but to request them or offer them 
						you will have to take part of it.</a></p></li>
					<li><h3>Set your profile:</h3> 
					<p>Tell people what you can do, include links of your projects, add and remove skills, tell people 
						when you are available to help or in which area you work.</p></li>
					<li><h3>Search for skills:</h3> 
					<p>You can always use the search bar or explore the site to see what is on offer.</p></li>
					<li><h3>Request skills:</h3> 
					<p>Just pushing a button you will be asking someone for help. Telling them when, how and in what.</p></li>
					<li><h3>Receive requests:</h3> 
					<p>You can also help others, all of us have something to offer!</p></li>
					<li><h3>Close transactions:</h3> 
					<p>Once you have collaborated in a project you can close a transaction. This means you can 
						rate the people you worked with, give reviews for others to see. And more importantly set 
						the time in hours you spent working together. </p></li>
					<li><h3>Helppy is free:</h3> 
					<p>This is a community built on a basis of trust and welfare. There is no need for money. 
						However, the duration that you set when closing a transaction is displayed on your profile. 
						We like to keep things transparent so everyone knows how much time you 
						have helped others and how much you have been helped. Your ratings and reviews are always publicly visible.</p></li>
